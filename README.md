# econ-8310-final-project
Midterm and Final Project/Exam Econ 8310 - Business Forecasting

The Goal
This project is designed to give you a chance to create a solution to a complex real-world problem using the tools from this course as well as previous
courses. My intent is to allow you and your team (this is REQUIRED to be
a group project) to demonstrate your ability to identify the problem, find the
necessary data, choose an appropriate solution from your forecasting toolkit,
and present your solution to the rest of the class. The problem will be provided by the instructor, but it will be your job to interpret that problem and
create insights.
